This ~~is~~ was a website for checking if Thomas Bryant was currently checked in
to the current Pacers game.

The project was initially created as a joke among friends during the Pacers
run in the 2024-25 NBA post-season along with providing an excuse to try out
HTMX for fun. They ended up getting all the way to the finals and losing in
Game 7. On September 23rd, 2025, Thomas Bryant would sign a 1-year contract
with the Cavaliers. There is no longer a need for this site.
